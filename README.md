Online Shopping Data Analysis with Data Science Techniques

Welcome to the repository for my data science assignment, where I explore and analyze data from an online shopping website called Light in the Box. In this project, I dive into a category of my choice, utilizing web scraping techniques, data manipulation with Pandas, and visualization through Jupyter Notebooks.

Assignment Overview
Steps Undertaken:

Website Selection:
Chose an online shopping website called Light in the Box.
Explored a specific category (video games Category).

Web Scraping:
Utilized web scraping to extract relevant data from the chosen website.
Identified unique HTML attributes associated with the desired data points (e.g., product name, price, rating).

Data Processing:
Stored the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame for efficient manipulation and analysis.

Analysis and Visualization:
Employed various data science techniques learned in class to gain insights.
Utilized Pandas functionalities for data exploration.
Created visualizations using Matplotlib or any other preferred plotting library.

Jupyter Notebook:
Developed and executed the entire analysis within a Jupyter Notebook.
Ensured the final output, including visualizations, is visible within the notebook.

GitHub Repository:
Created a new repository on GitHub to host the project.
Uploaded the Jupyter Notebook, ensuring it reflects the entire analysis process.
